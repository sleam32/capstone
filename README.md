My original Capstone idea was to create a code reading web application that would make filtering through open source code more specific to what you're looking for and a more organized process. The goal was to reference an open source Api database and allow for filtering by programming language and level of difficulty, for example Beginner, Intermediate or Expert level code. 

The application that I have created currently is running along the same lines as the original idea, only I've created my own database instead of referencing a seperate Api. This came about through necessity because I never found the type of Api I would've needed. So this is a single page web application that allows a user to enter in information about their open source projects and is marketed toward start up ideas that are just getting off the ground and need more exposure. Such information as the project title, a short description of how to contribute, what language the application is written in, an email address for further contact and a url link to Github.com are all provided and stored within the app. 

Information entered into the application is sortable by alphabet and filterable by programming language and level of difficulty for ease of use and navigation. No plug-ins were used for sorting or filtering. 

Problems/Issues:
No connection to the server on Backlift, therefore any information entered into the application is lost after any page refresh. For the sake of example and in order to properly demonstrate the functionality of the app, I've written mock info into the HTML.

The Twitter Api I was hoping to use to feed software/programming related tweets to the application is unusable without Backlift as well.
